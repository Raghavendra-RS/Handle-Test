You can enforce conditions like:

Require pull requests before merging

Require status checks (like CI/CD passing)

Require review by specific users (doer & checker model)

Require signed commits

Prevent direct pushes to main/master

✅ This enforces policies at server-side, meaning no push/merge unless all checks pass.
