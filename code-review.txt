Code Review Policy (Doer & Checker Model)

GitHub supports a “Doer-Checker” (a.k.a. four-eyes principle) through:

Pull Request Reviews:
Require at least 1 approval before merging.

Restrict who can push/merge:
In Branch Protection → “Restrict who can push to matching branches.”

This ensures:

Developer (Doer) raises the PR

Reviewer/Lead (Checker) reviews & approves it

Merge allowed only after approval ✅
