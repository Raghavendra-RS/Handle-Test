Goal: Developer cannot push directly to main; must raise PR → tests + review pass → merge allowed.

✅ Steps:

Enable branch protection for main

Require pull requests before merging

Add GitHub Action workflow for lint/tests

Mark the workflow as “Required Status Check”

Require 1 reviewer approval (Checker)

Now your DevEx includes:

Pre-push validation via CI

Controlled merges via PR reviews

Secure, auditable workflow 🚀
